# ECO<sub>2</sub>Travel
ECO<sub>2</sub>Travel promotes more environmentally friendly travel options with an emphasis on sustainability for a cleaner tomorrow â€“ rewarding those who choose to travel green by offering rewards to users who choose to travel green. This application allows for users to search for flights like a traditional platform, but places an emphasis on "eco-grades." These "eco-grades" are calculated through CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per passenger and are relative to the mode of transport that produces the least emissions per passenger. Each result is given an "eco-grade." In addition to flight results, this platform also gives users results for eco-friendly alternatives which consist of other forms of travel, such as trains and buses. Points are awarded for choosing the most eco-friendly flight OR one of the eco-friendly alternatives and these points add up to a membership status which would grant the user additional benefits like percent off of flights. This is aimed to create incentive for users to utilize more green transport methods.
